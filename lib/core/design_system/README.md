# Design system

Design system is the look and feel of the coffee application.

Design system can be made into its own package and be imported through pubspec.yaml.

For this demo I decided not to that way the architecture doesn't seem overwhelming but with melos
and the path parameter in pubspec.yaml it is easy to separate this into its own package.
